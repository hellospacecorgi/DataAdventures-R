Reproducible Data Analytics Report on Shark Control Statistics (R)

This is a data analytics report on Shark Control Program Catch Statistics from the Agriculture and Fisheries Department under Queensland Government. It was done as part of a group project for Statistical Thinking with Data.

2 Research questions were investigated:
- Correlations between the water temperature and the location


- Correlation between length of tiger sharks and the water temperature.

Main discoveries include identifying locations in which sharks appear in the largest and hottest water temperature ranges, and no evidence of linear correlation between length of tiger sharks and water temperature.
